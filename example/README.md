An example command-line application to test the lastfm package.

1. It looks up public stuff.
2. It authenticates you.
3. It likes Shinedown's Get Up for you. Because obviously you love it. Just telling you so you know to undo it ;)
4. It scrobbles a specific song from the 1987 album "Whenever You Need Somebody." You should definitely check your scrobbles after this ;)

NOTE: you need to provide the `API_KEY` environment/`--define` variable, and optionally `SHARED_SECRET` for the authenticated stuff.
