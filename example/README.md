An example command-line application to test the lastfm package.

1. It looks up public stuff.
2. It authenticates you.
3. It likes Shinedown's Get Up for you. Because obviously you love it. Just telling you so you know to undo it ;)

NOTE: you need to provide the `API_KEY` environment/`--define` variable, and optionally `SHARED_SECRET` for the authenticated stuff.
